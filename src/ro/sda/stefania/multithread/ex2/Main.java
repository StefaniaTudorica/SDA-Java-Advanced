/**
 * *You are the manager. You have 5 employees.
 * Simulate the situation in which each of them comes at a different time to work.
 * - Every employee, after getting to work, displays the information "<name: I came to work at <time HH:MM>."
 * - Every 10 seconds, the employee displays „name: I'm still working!"
 *   c) Every 30 seconds, we release one of the employees to home (remember about stopping the thread!)
 *   and remove the employee from the „active employees list"
 * - When you release your employee to home, print „, it's time to go home!"
 * - *When you release a given employee, all of the others speed up. From that moment, display the information about work 2 seconds faster. f) ** The manager decides in which order release employees (e.g. through an earlier defined list)
